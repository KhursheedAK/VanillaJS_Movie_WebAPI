<h1>Live Site: https://khursheedak.github.io/VanillaJS_Movie_WebAPI/</h1>
<p>A fun and simple movie browsing app built with vanilla JavaScript and Axios. You can search for movies, filter results in real-time, and flip through pages with pagination. Each movie shows its poster, title, release year, and rank in a clean, responsive grid.

Working on this project was a very rewarding for me! It helped me get better at fetching data from APIs, manipulating the DOM, handling user input, and building pagination. I learned a lot and had fun making a simple, interactive app that actually works with live movie data.

For movie data, I used the <a href="https://imdb.iamidiotareyoutoo.com/docs/index.html#description/introduction"> IMDb API </a> to fetch movies based on their titles.</p>
